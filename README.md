# README

> üìÖ It's super easy [to forget](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/585801) so aim to practice once per week!

This is the killer. If I step away from programming for a few weeks, you really feel the rust gathering. This repository is a testing ground for all things Elm, and it's a year-long learning curve to get building.

There's plenty of [javascript guides](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) out there, so here the focus is on a statically typed functional style that turns you into a good programmer. For a study aid, you can use [Anki flashcards](https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/anki) and [these handy guides](https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/anki/discussions/123) to get you started. It's great for revision, but no substitute for _building_ things.

## üî∞ Beginners

> Elm is great for learning how to engineer.

Start with [How To Design Programs](https://htdp.org/) and follow that up with Elm. It's **better designed**, more **consistent**, with **better compiler error messages** than [Python](https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/python-playground).

After these two languages you'll have a decent grounding in Computer Science theory, and they're not too academic. I'm rubbish at maths, and am mostly focused on rapid prototyping, so I like to avoid deep academic learning. An artist ships!


## üöÄ Getting started

> [Here would be a great place for a book!]

Things I'd love to know if I were to start over:

1. The subset of CompSci for prototyping
2. Best practices for `json` and `REST` APIs
3. How to use Ai for learning (and how not to)
4. How to frame and structure your learning (fail fast, just build!)

### Basic commands

```terminal
# Initialise an Elm project
elm init

# Install a package
elm install elm/<package>

# Make a HTML file from an Elm one
elm make src/Main.elm

# Compile to javascript file
elm make src/Main.elm --output=app.js

# View in the browser
elm reactor
```

### ‚≠ê Why Elm, then?

#### Types and inference

> Why do we need types? It's best illustrated by the old joke ...

A programmer's wife told him "Go to the store and buy milk and if they have eggs, get a dozen." He came back a while later with 12 cartons of milk!

#### Beautiful error messages

This is where Elm really shines, everything is easy to install and just works! Unlike Python, where there's many ways to manage packages, the error messages are cryptic, and so on.

#### How to document your code

- Here's [how packages are documented](https://package.elm-lang.org/help/documentation-format)
- Elm package [design guidelines](https://package.elm-lang.org/help/design-guidelines)

#### Testing

> I'm lazy, and rarely test, but it's good practice to.
