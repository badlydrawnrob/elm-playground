# Stuff to add to Anki?

Learning and teaching with programming takes quite a bit of breaking things down and moving up in small steps, so that the student understands what options they have, and how to write things more succinctly.

- [ ] Which texts or online learning get it right?
- [ ] How could you break down that learning for better Anki cards?

## Candidates for an Anki card

### Chapter 01/02

1. `++` and `==` as these are different from Lisp
2. Higher order functions
3. An anonymous function example
4. What is a higher order function?
5. Can you mix types in a list?
6. A quick note on the DOM?
7. We improved `selectedUrl` in `viewThumbnail` which looks much better using `classList` http://tinyurl.com/5enp9ndh
8. The `Html` module can make for some verbose code (see 7). Ways to cutcodedown?
9. Explain partial application in the `List.map (viewThumbnail ...)` section.
10. A couple of examples of currying [(partially applying functions)](https://www.codingexercises.com/guides/quickstart-elm-part-7) — also in [Scheme](http://tinyurl.com/scheme-lang-currying). See Table 2.1 (add a note on difference between default and tupled functions)
    - Why does the function work after it was changed from this version? http://tinyurl.com/elm-lang-before-currying
11. Understanding [`Html msg`](http://tinyurl.com/elm-lang-html-msg)
