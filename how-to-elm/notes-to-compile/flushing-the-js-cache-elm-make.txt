# How to "flush" or hard refresh elm's compiled js?

> Creating a new `js` file seems to solve the problem so far ...
> For some reason `.js?v1` versioning didn't work either ..
> Just a blank screen :expressionless: 

Sometimes after refactors (in this case, renaming modules) or in a couple other instances, Elm's compiled javascript goes stale — as in, it doesn't seem to flush the old stuff properly with `elm make` ...

For instance, `Elm.OldName.StillWorks.init` when it should be `Elm.NewName.Refreshed.init`. Changing the `init` in the html file to the new module name leads to a white screen.

- Any tips on how to manage this when it happens?
- Any other long-standing bugs with the compiler to watch out for?

I've seen @RyanNHG using [Vite for live reloads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVsgBJqTOIE&list=PLuGpJqnV9DXq_ItwwUoJOGk_uCr72Yvzb&index=29), but you don't want this kind of thing happening in production!

Creating a new file allowed me to use the `?version` hack.
