# Writing and communicating

> Write for your stupid future self.
> Focus on "The Image" and sales funnel first and foremost.
> Maybe the women in tech have a bit of a point about the atmosphere?

Shallow knowledge is OK for entrepreneurs, but it's helpful to have a grounding in the fundamentals. When you only have [7 days to validate](..) your business idea, what do you focus on? (Eg. NOT programming, but marketing and sales). Your goal for the early stages of the startup should be as little code as possible to get the job done.


## Technical writing

> See that other article on technical writing.
> Reduce terminology. Simple language. Whizz-bang examples.
> Have a good editor. Can a child or beginner understand easily?

Tech takes so long to write about and the terminology can leave a lot of misunderstanding. For example, using technical language _only_ to describe types is futile. It's hard to follow. It all feels very tangled and difficult to infer meaning (or which part of the code you're talking about.

You must have fun, memorable, examples; images and simple language, very specific detail in the right place of the code (inline comments?), to aid understanding (what, exactly, are you referring to?); you must keep the language non-academic, concise, and pointed. Reduce disjointed text from the code samples that are hard to pair up.

Language is also important, as I'm not a huge fan of ReasonML modules or the `t` type convention (compared to Elm Lang). It all seems a bit messier with duplicated code (module type and module instance could all be within one file).


## On dealing with people

> Is this question essential? Or pre-optimisation?
> Have you planned what you need to ask? Concrete and concise?
> Are you deviating into unrelated territory? Stay on-topic!

**Young guys probably have (when dealing with others):** Big opinions, lack of patience, a bit of arrogance, low experience

**Which can lead to:** Discouraging beginners, arguments, misunderstanding, and so on.


1. I spend a lot (too much) time writing (and editing) my issue posts
2. I try to write clearly and simply, for people with poor grasp of English
3. I try to ELi5 where possible (an answer without an example is useless)
4. I try not to assume too much about the person (there's no stupid Qs)
5. I try not to be too opinionated or talk down to the person
6. I often feel I'm not good enough at programming (but I've done it for years)
7. Remember people don't know you, it can take a while to warm them up
8. Remember people might know your level or intention
