# Next steps

> The goal is to prototype as quickly as possible.
> I also need to spend 50% time on business and marketing.
> My goals may differ from yours! It's not lazyness, it's smarts.

1. Create your learning frame
2. Consolidate useful information
3. How can I simplify this program?
4. What do I need to delegate?
5. What can Ai, or a tool, do for me?
6. What's the quickest way to do `X`?[^1]


## Useful information:

> There's a lot you'll learn from doing (or with a mentor)
> Which bits are "for me"? Within or without my learning frame.

- The `"2:00"` problem and `"cur|sor"` (simplify your inputs)
- DRAW! first and sketch out the problem routes (how many steps to do a thing?)
- Simplify your types (`SingleField.elm` and is this necessary?)
- `Passport.elm` and removing problems from your learning frame
    - The "checklist for validating" is very useful
- Just use a form building tool first (build in Elm later/never)
- Treat some programs like a black box (I don't need to understand it)
- Which learning points are high-level? Which are low-level (of understanding)
- Which things need to be built-in to your app? Which can be glue-code? (or offline)
- Understand what each part is for (model, view, update, messages)
- Don't store computed data in the model or database (what is computed data?)


## Anki cards

> Create some "good cards" for the basics

Consolidate the `/notes-to-compile` with the essential bits.


## "Not my problem"

> Black box recorder

1. An email notification system (outsource)
2. A text editor (parsing text is difficult)
3. Building games with code (it takes ages just to land a UFO)
4. The time it takes to learn a new language (Go, OCaml, etc)



[^1]: For example, [v0](https://v0.dev/) is super quick at mocking up UIs. You can't very well build Elm programs in it (only React?) but it might be great at mocking up data structures. And [CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is handy so long as you've got a programming background. What can LLMs achieve? What about micro ones like [Phi](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/)?
