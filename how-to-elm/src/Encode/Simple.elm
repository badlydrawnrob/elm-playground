{-| âœ… A nested object with a list
    ==============================

    This is easier than I thought. You simply create atoms, blocks, and
    combine them together like legos.

    1. A `List Int` is self-explanatory
    2. An `Object`, such as `{"key": "value"}` requires converting your
       Elm data type (such as a record) into a `List Tuple` of key/value.


    TO DO
    -----

    Find an easier way to extract our `UUID` in a function.
    Can we do it in point-free style?


    Optional, `Nothing` and `null`
    ------------------------------

    I've been told that it's generally better to not store empty or default
    data in `json` if it doesn't exist, for instance `Maybe` types. Better
    to keep things simple and simply not store it.

    - You can use `Maybe.withDefault` for non-existant values
    - You can use `optional` with NoRedInk's `Json.Decode.Pipeline`
    - You can store an empty value as `null` or `[]` in json.

    [^1]: It's a bit more work to use codecs or hack json to store a
          custom type. Better to store it as plain json data types and
          wait until (potentially) Evan figures out how to do this cleanly.


    Here's how we do it ...
    -----------------------

    1. Create our blocks of data from atoms
    2. Store them as constants
    3. Optionally create empty values
    4. Create a `List Tuple` wrapped in an `object`
    5. Wrap them in a `"collection"` object.
    6. Render our json with `encode` and print as text.
